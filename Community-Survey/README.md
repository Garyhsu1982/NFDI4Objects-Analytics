# Archaeometry Community Survey

## Introduction
[The survey](
https://survey.nfdi4objects.net/index.php/347578?lang=en), carried out from March to July 2024, is primarily aimed at researchers whose work involves the scientific analysis of archaeological materials. This initiative is conducted by the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum (DBM) in the framework of NFDI4Objects, an integral part of the National Research Data Infrastructure dedicated to the material heritage of human and environmental history. 

DBM is one of the executive members in the task area "Analytics and Experiments", which will cover platforms, standards and services for desktop-based research, controlled experiments, and laboratory-based analysis of objects. 

This survey is designed to obtain an overview of the following research practices for analytical data: 

How do you organise your analytical data and associated metadata, especially those related to measurement parameters and experimental protocols? 
What kind of tools or data services do you use or desire for data collection, data analysis, data evaluation, data dissemination, and data archiving? For instance, Authority File and Vocabulary Services (AVS), Data Services (DaS), Software Application Services (SAS), and Discovery Services (DiS).
Your answers and suggestions would provide us with guidelines to establish a national platform that facilitates data standardisation, data sharing and exchange, the provision of desired service tools, and extensive national networking among the archaeometry community. Meanwhile, this survey will also be used to build up a catalogue of analytical services potentially offered by archaeometrically-oriented laboratories.
