# Laboratory Services

## E-RIHS
We are working closely with the European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science ([E-RIHS](https://www.e-rihs.eu/#:~:text=E%2DRIHS%20is%20the%20European,training%20opportunities%20in%20heritage%20science.)) to develope a knowledge base for analytical serivces offered by archaeometric laboratories.
A number of data models have been created in order to describe and assess metadata information about analytical instruments and protocols. They are supported by rich [controlled vocabularies](https://vocab.e-rihs.io/), Handle PIDs, and an [online registration tool](https://e-rihs.io/register-services/) based on [Cordra](https://data.e-rihs.io/#urls/objects/design?payload=about.html).

## Front-end discovery service
Our goal is to use the E-RIHS system to collect use cases from archaeometric laboratories. This would allow us to establish a linked open database for analytical services and through which a front-end search portal can be introduced. A good example of such an application is presented by the [GeoX Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam](https://www.geo-x.net/geox-laboratory-infrastructure-search/)
