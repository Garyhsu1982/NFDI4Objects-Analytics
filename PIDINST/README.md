# Instrument PIDs

[PIDINST](https://docs.pidinst.org/en/latest/) is a working group within the Research Data Alliance (RDA) and aims to establish a cross-discipline, operational solution for the unique and lasting identification of measuring instruments actively operated in the sciences. It regulates the necessary metadata profile to describe analytical devices that can be associated with a PID. A free registration service is provided by [B2INST](https://b2inst.gwdg.de/) which adheres to the guideline of the PIDINST
