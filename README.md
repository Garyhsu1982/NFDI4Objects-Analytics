# NFDI4Objects-Analytics
## Description
This repository documents the works related to the development of protocols, guidelines, and best practices for analytics in archaeometry within the framework of [NFDI4Objects](https://www.nfdi4objects.net/index.php/en/nfdi4objects-english). It provides the authorâ€™s current initiatives and online resources/tools that assist archaeological scientists in organising their samples and analytical results in a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) manner. To accomplish this, we are actively participating in various working groups, both within the NFDI consortia and beyond, focusing on topics such as the PIDs, metadata schemas, electronic lab notebooks, laboratory service catalogues, and data repositories.

## Outline
Our works are classified into several topics: 
- Sample persistent identifiers (IGSN)
- Scientific instrument persistent identifiers (PIDINST)
- Temporary working group for device metadata
- Archaeometry community survey
- Electronic lab notebooks
- Experimental workflow tools
- Registration of lab services
- Related data repositories
- Presentations and posters
